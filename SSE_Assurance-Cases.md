### Alignment of Evidence

In the Vendor-Verifier Assurance Case above, there are three main pieces of evidence that need to be supplied. The first is that the vast majority of traveler's don't lose their phones. While outside of the domain of the system's software, this evidence provides assurance that the intended user can utilize the system. According to a [Statista survery from 2015](https://www.statista.com/statistics/441650/items-lost-stolen-while-traveling/#:~:text=The%20statistic%20shows%20the%20share,a%20smartphone%20stolen%20whilst%20traveling.), 10% of traveler's lose their phone while traveling. While 10% may sound like a low number, for critical functions such as access to a country, this must be evaluated to be acceptable or not. The second evidence is a Hyper Ledger security report. The Cloud Security Alliance published a [security report on Hyper Ledger in 2021](https://theblockchaintest.com/uploads/resources/CSA%20-%20Hyperledger%20Fabric%2020%20Architecture%20Security%20Report%20-%202021.pdf) with an accompanying [Security Controls Checklist](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/hyperledger-fabric-2-0-architecture-security-controls-checklist/) that provides a guide for aligning with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The third evidence is a code review to ensure that the verifier is in charge of determining the jurisdiction of governance the traveler is being verified in. This can be done manually by looking at the verifier agent's source code. There does not appear to be any documentation explicitly mentioning how this is handled.

In the Traveler-Consent Assurance Case, there are three main pieces of evidence to supply. E1 is [Cardea User Mobile Agent's "Settings" page](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/cardea-mobile-agent/blob/main/components/Settings/index.js) accessible on the app. Different languages can be set on this page to accomidate those who cannot read English. [E2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/18/3b.5) and [E3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.502) each refer to different sections of HIPAA's Privacy Rule. E4 is backed by the Youtube video from Indicio: ["Verifiable Health Data: Demonstrating Verifiable Credentials using Cardea"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruhnyMTqNog&list=LL&index=37&t=2337s) at the 35:16 mark. 

In the Issuer Assurance Case, there are four pieces of evidence to supply. E1 refers to the [Cardea White Paper](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/cardea.app/blob/main/attachments/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf), which gives a high-level view on how the software works. Page 15 shows how the issuer is the only one who has access to the blockchain. E2 is from [this Mimecast article](https://www.mimecast.com/blog/what-is-dos-attack-and-how-to-prevent-it/) that explains best practices for mitigating DoS attacks. These practices would be a desireable feature of Cardea. E3 refers to [this Hyperledger Indy documentation](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/#uniqueness-of-dids) that explains how hash collisions in the blockchain are unlikely yet possible. Although the evidence itself is outside the scope of Cardea, it shows how hash colliding is accountable on the Cardea's software rather the blockchain's software. Cardea does not handle hash collisions for the blockchain so preventing that would be a desirable feature. E4 refers to Section 6.1 of [this Hyperledger Indy documentation](https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/design/005-dkms/DKMS%20Design%20and%20Architecture%20V3.html?highlight=backup#offline-recovery), which shows the offline recovery feature of its blockchain. It works by storing an offline encrypted backup of each owner's Cardea "wallet". 

In the Mobile Agent Vulnerability Assurance case, there are six pieces of evidence to assure the top claim is true. The first, Apple and Google software 
security documentation, is difficult to track down. Apple has [security overview documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/app-security-overview-sec35dd877d0/web), but lacks technical documentation. Google seems to rely on [Google Play Protect](https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect) to monitor for malicious apps and also lacks technical documentation. The second evidence is NIST documentation on secure configuration, which can be found [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-128.pdf). The third evidence consists of documentation on secure hashing is found in the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) and [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.202.pdf). The fourth piece of evidence is GitHub's documentation on their access control as a secure sytem, which can be found in their [Get Started](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github) documentation. The fifth piece of evidence is documentation on access of the application domain to the user's phone number to be able to implement multi-factor authentication. The only place we've found this mentioned explicitly without verifying through source code analysis is [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruhnyMTqNog&list=LL&index=37&t=2337s) on Cardea's credentials implementation. The final piece of evidence is a code review report. While this report does not currently exist to determine if this feature is possible, a [quick perusal of source code](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/cardea-mobile-agent/blob/main/components/Settings/index.js) shows there is space for this feature to be implemented.
